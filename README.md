# Learning

A place to put notes/exercises from courses and books I'm working through. There are
three main folders:

1. Courses: Actual guided courses (e.g. coursera content)
2. Books: Exercises and/or notes on books.
3. Concepts: A hodge-podge of reference materials, high-level notes, examples, etc. Meant to
   be an encyclopedia or dictionary of stuff that I'd like to remember.
